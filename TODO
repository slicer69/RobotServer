See if robot can detect different colours as it drives over them?
Different colours do give different light levels. Yellow the
lowest, then red, then blue.
Difference of about 1,000 per colour change in low light or 5,000 in high light.
eg. 8k, 9k, 11k vs 7k, 12k, 17k

Seems to be consistent across materials.
Add "colour" command. Can set or detect colours.
colour red <level> (set approximate level)
colour blue <level>
colour yellow <level>
colour detect (report the coloru under us) 
colour match (change lights to match colour under buggy)


Make it possible to adjust left/right engine power so it does not
need to adjusted in the code.

Make it possible to adjust turn time modifier so we do not need to
adjust it in code.

Make it possible to adjust light brightness.
(Finished - test)
